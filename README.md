ABSTRACT

Cricket is India's most popular sport, with various formats like Twenty20 International (T20), One Day International (ODI), and Test matches. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a highly popular cricket tournament featuring players from regional and international teams. The Indian Premier League (IPL) significantly boosts India's economy, contributing billions of rupees annually. Each season generates substantial revenue through broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, creating job opportunities across multiple sectors. The IPL's economic ripple effect extends to tourism, hospitality, and advertising industries. Its contribution to India's gross income exemplifies how sports can serve as a catalyst for economic growth. Predicting the outcome of IPL matches is important for online traders and sponsors. Factors influencing predictions include team composition, player averages, previous match success, and traditional elements like the toss, venue, and day-night conditions. This project aims to predict IPL match outcomes using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier (RFC) and Gradient Boosting.
